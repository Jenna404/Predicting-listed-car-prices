# Predicting-listed-car-prices
The objective is to forecast the prices of listed cars on the basis of car attributes. Participants will need to conduct exploratory data analysis, clean the dataset, fill in any missing values, construct predictive models, and deliver their forecasts.

The training dataset contains 3500 entries with 39 variables, while the test set includes 1500 observations of 38 variables. The target variable is the price.

Steps in the project:

- Data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, EDA
- Hyper parameter tuning and model selection: Linear regression, XGBoost, Random forest, Ridge, Gradient Boosted, Kernel Ridge, Bagging, Adaptive Boost, Multiple Layer Perceptron
- Other model tests: stacking regressor, feature importance, feature selection and extraction (PCA LDA KPCA)
- Method of evaluation: RMSE
- Gradient Boosted model did the best on this dataset to predict car prices.

Skills Evaluated:
